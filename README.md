# ðŸ“Š Security Test Coverage Framework

This repository formalizes the process of asking: **"Have we detected everything that matters?"** across MITRE ATT&CK techniques. It provides a structured, testable, and repeatable way to evaluate visibility, detection quality, and priority coverage.

## ðŸŽ¯ Why This Repo Exists

Most teams focus on alerts and SIEM dashboards â€” few ask whether their detections meaningfully map to threat behavior.

This framework helps:
- Track **coverage vs. gaps** across ATT&CK TTPs
- Prioritize detection based on **threat intel, asset risk, and visibility**
- Create **detection test plans** aligned to real adversary behavior
- Mature from reactive alerting to **proactive detection engineering**

## ðŸ“‚ Folder Structure

| Folder              | Description |
|---------------------|-------------|
| `coverage-maps/`    | ATT&CK matrix maps with color-coded coverage tiers |
| `tests/`            | YAML/Markdown test cases for detection verification |
| `prioritization/`   | Threat modeling input, asset criticality, and gap scoring |
| `methodology/`      | Writeups on how to assess detection quality & coverage depth |
| `tools/`            | Scripts or templates for automating test and coverage collection |
| `docs/`             | Background on detection validation and ATT&CK alignment |

## ðŸ§ª Core Concepts

- **Coverage**: Do we have logging and detections in place for this technique?
- **Depth**: Are detections behavioral or superficial (e.g., signature-based)?
- **Quality**: Can detections withstand evasions, and are they high-confidence?
- **Priority**: Does this matter based on threat relevance and asset context?

## ðŸš¨ Signal
Creating and maintaining this framework shows:
- **Deep thinking** about detection maturity
- Awareness of **coverage and prioritization tradeoffs**
- Ability to **operationalize MITRE** in a structured and transparent way

## ðŸ“œ Legal
Do not simulate or test adversary behavior on production systems without explicit authorization.

This repo is designed for security leaders, detection engineers, and red/blue teams who want to evolve beyond one-off detections and toward **systematic security validation.**
